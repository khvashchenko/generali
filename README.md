# Generali landing page

## Project Presentation
Hello! I would like to present my test project, in which I implemented a responsive website using modern libraries and technologies.

**Key Features of the Project:**

- *Responsiveness:* The website displays correctly on all devices.
- *Libraries:* I integrated several popular libraries, such as intl-tel-input for phone numbers, ion.RangeSlider for sliders, and Swiper for creating image sliders.
- *Form Validation:* I implemented form validation to enhance the user experience.
- *Tablet Resolution:* I also adapted the layout for tablet resolution, as this was not included in the initial design.
- *Data Logging:* All form data is logged to the console for easy debugging and testing.
- *Regarding the Design:* I want to note that I did not adhere to pixel-perfect precision in executing the layout, as the initial design was created without considering UI/UX design principles. In my implementation, I focused on adhering to these principles to ensure usability and intuitiveness for users.

I hope you enjoy my project!
